                    src="https://www.gujarattourism.com/content/dam/gujrattourism/images/religious-sites/somnath-temple/gallery/Somnath-Temple-(23).jpg"
                    width="750px">
                <p>The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient
                    times on account of being a Triveni Sangam (the confluence
                    of three rivers: Kapila, Hiran and Saraswati). Soma, the
                    Moon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a
                    curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to
                    regain it. The result is said to be the waxing and waning of
                    the moon. The name of the town, Prabhasa, meaning lustre, as
                    well as the alternative name Someshvara
                    ("the lord of the moon" or "the moon god"), arise from this
                    tradition.</p><br>

                <p>The name Someshvara begins to appear starting in the 9th
                    century. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II (r.
                    805-833) recorded that he has visited tirthas in Saurashtra,
                    including Someshvara. Romila Thapar states that this may not
                    imply the existence of a temple, but rather that it was a
                    pilgrimage site (tirtha). The Chaulukya (Solanki) king
                    Mularaja possibly built the first temple for Soma
                    ("moon god") at the site sometime before 997 CE, even though
                    some historians believe that he may have renovated a smaller
                    earlier temple.</p><br>

                <p>In 1026, during the reign of Bhima I, the Turkic Muslim ruler
                    Mahmud of Ghazni raided and plundered the Somnath temple,
                    breaking its jyotirlinga. He took away a booty of 20 million
                    dinars.According to Romila Thapar, relying on a 1038
                    inscription of a Kadamba king of Goa, the condition of
                    Somnath temple in 1026 after Ghazni's is unclear because the
                    inscription is "puzzlingly silent" about Ghazni's raid or
                    temple's condition. This inscription, states Thapar, could
                    suggest that instead of destruction it may have been a
                    desecration because the temple seems to have been repaired
                    quickly within twelve years and was an active pilgrimage
                    site by 1038.</p><br>

                <p>The raid of 1026 by Mahmud is confirmed by the 11th-century
                    Persian historian Al-Biruni, who worked in the court of
                    Mahmud, who accompanied Mahmud's troops between 1017 and
                    1030 CE on some occasions, and who lived in the northwest
                    Indian subcontinent region - over regular intervals, though
                    not continuously. The invasion of Somnath site in 1026 CE is
                    also confirmed by other Islamic historians such as Gardizi,
                    Ibn Zafir and Ibn al-Athir. However, two Persian sources -
                    one by adh-Dhahabi and other by al-Yafi'i - state it as 1027
                    CE, which is likely incorrect and late by a year, according
                    to Khan - a scholar known for his studies on Al-Biruni and
                    other Persian historians. According to Al-Biruni:</p> <br>

                <p>The location of the Somnath temple was a little less than
                    three miles west of the mouth of the river Sarasvati. The
                    temple was situated on the coast of the Indian ocean so that
                    at the time of flow the idol was bathed by its water. Thus
                    that moon was perpetually occupied in bathing the idol and
                    serving it."</p><br>

                <p>The floor plan and ruins of a pre-1000 CE temple were
                    unearthed during the archaeological excavations led by B.K.
                    Thapar. Most of the temple is lost, but the remains of the
                    foundation, the lower structure as well as pieces of the
                    temple ruins suggest an "exquisitely carved, rich" temple.
                    According to Dhaky – a scholar of Indian temple
                    architecture, this is the earliest known version of the
                    Somnath temple. It was, what historic Sanskrit vastu sastra
                    texts call the tri-anga sandhara prasada. Its garbhagriha
                    (sanctum) was connected to a mukhamandapa (entrance hall)
                    and gudhamandapa.</p><br>

                <p>The temple opened to the east. The stylobate of this
                    destroyed temple had two parts: the 3 feet high pitha-socle
                    and the vedibandha-podium. The pitha had a tall bhitta,
                    joined to the jadyakumbha, ornamented with what Dhaky calls
                    "crisp and charming foliage pattern". The kumbha of the
                    Vedibandha had a Surasenaka with a niche that contained the
                    figure of Lakulisa – this evidence affirms that the lost
                    temple was a Shiva temple.</p><br>

                <p>The excavations yielded pieces of one at the western end,
                    which suggests that the kumbhas were aligned to the entire
                    wall. Above the kalaga moulding was an antarapatta, states
                    Dhaky, but no information is available to determine its
                    design or ornamentation. The surviving fragment of the
                    kapotapali that was discovered suggests that at
                    "intervals, it was decorated with contra-posed half thakaras, with large, elegant, and carefully shaped gagarakas in suspension graced the lower edge of the kapotapali",
                    states Dhaky.[89] The garbhagriha had a vedibandha, possibly
                    with a two-layered jangha with images on the main face
                    showing the influence of the late Maha-Maru style. Another
                    fragment found had a
                    "beautifully moulded rounded pillarette and a ribbed khuraccadya-awning topped the khattaka".</p><br>

                <p>The mukhachatuski, states Dhaky, likely broke and fell
                    immediately after the destructive hit by Mahmud's troops.
                    These fragments suffered no further erosion or damage one
                    would normally expect, likely because it was left in the
                    foundation pit of the new Somnath temple that was rebuilt
                    quickly after Mahmud left. The "quality of craftsmanship" in
                    these fragments is "indeed high", the carvings of the lost
                    temple were "rich and exquisite", states Dhaky. Further, a
                    few pieces have an inscription fragment in the 10th-century
                    characters – which suggests that this part of the temple or
                    the entire temple was built in the 10th century.</p> <br>

                <p>The Somnath temple is located along the coastline in Prabhas
                    Patan, Veraval, Saurashtra region of Gujarat. It is about
                    400 kilometres (249 mi) southwest of Ahmedabad, 82
                    kilometres (51 mi) south of Junagadh – another major
                    archaeological and pilgrimage site in Gujarat. It is about 7
                    kilometres (4 mi) southeast of the Veraval railway junction,
                    about 130 kilometres (81 mi) southeast of the Porbandar
                    airport and about 85 kilometres (53 mi) west of the Diu
